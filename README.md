# Hand Gesture Recognition Model

## Overview

This repository contains a hand gesture recognition model that identifies and classifies different hand gestures from image or video data. The model enables intuitive human-computer interaction through gesture-based control systems.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition:** Identifies and classifies predefined hand gestures.
- **Model Input:** Accepts image or video data for real-time recognition.
- **Compatibility:** Supports integration with existing systems for gesture-based control.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning model)
- OpenCV (for handling image/video input)
- NumPy, matplotlib (for data manipulation and visualization)

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing this hand gesture recognition model is the LeapGestureRecog dataset, which is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog).
